Todo
====

- Fix up internal exceptions
- Babel test cases
- Add docstrings to tower.py
- Figure out how we would support a non-template based generator.
- Introduce a file that imports all the necessary babel descriptions together.
    - Version should be specified in this file, or overwritten on the command line?
- Autogenerated tests / testserver1/2
- Fix server code to not output "OrderedDict" in code. Or, fix pretty print to do it better.
- Docstring conversion on a per language basis
- Accept indentation besides 4 spaces.
- Out of order type declarations.
- List(data_type=Float) -> List(Float)
- Add ability to give arbitrary tags to each endpoint (noauth, notify/content server)
- Perhaps errors shouldn't be printed to stdout immediately. They should be collected by the parser,
  and then printed by the caller if desired.
